# Demo Video Pipeline

Automated narrated demo video generation — fully scripted, no screen recording or manual voiceover needed.

## Pipeline Architecture

```
Script (JSON) → TTS engine (WAV clips) → Playwright (browser video) → ffmpeg (final MP4)
```

1. A **demo script** (`active-sessions-script.json`) defines segments with narration text and browser actions
2. A **TTS engine** generates a WAV audio clip for each segment's narration (see [TTS Providers](#tts-providers) below)
3. **Playwright** launches a browser with `recordVideo`, executes each action, and sleeps for the duration of the corresponding audio clip so video and narration stay in sync
4. **ffmpeg** concatenates audio clips (with silence gaps for pauses) and merges the combined audio track with the browser video into a final MP4

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Python dependencies (core)
pip install playwright

# Browser binary for Playwright
playwright install chromium

# ffmpeg (brew install ffmpeg) — provides both ffmpeg and ffprobe
```

Plus a TTS provider — see setup instructions below.

## TTS Providers

The pipeline supports swappable TTS backends selected via `--tts` flag. Three are available:

### Piper TTS (local, free, robotic)

Runs entirely offline. Fast and free, but the voice sounds noticeably synthetic.

```bash
# Install
pip install piper-tts pathvalidate

# Download the voice model (~60 MB, gitignored)
python -m piper.download_voices --download-dir demo/models en_US-lessac-medium
```

- Voice model: `en_US-lessac-medium` (also available in `high` quality)
- Model files land in `demo/models/` (gitignored)
- No API keys or network access required

### Google Cloud TTS (cloud, free tier, natural-sounding)

Uses Google's WaveNet voices — significantly more human-sounding than Piper.

**Free tier:** 1 million WaveNet characters/month, 4 million standard characters/month. A typical demo script is ~300 characters, so the free tier covers thousands of renders.

```bash
# Install gcloud CLI
brew install google-cloud-sdk

# Authenticate and set project
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project <YOUR_PROJECT_ID>

# Enable the TTS API
gcloud services enable texttospeech.googleapis.com
```

- Voice: `en-US-WaveNet-D` (male) — see [full voice list](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/voices)
- Requires billing enabled on the GCP project (free tier still applies)
- API call: `POST https://texttospeech.googleapis.com/v1/text:synthesize` with quota project header

**Quick test:**
```bash
ACCESS_TOKEN=$(gcloud auth print-access-token)
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-goog-user-project: <YOUR_PROJECT_ID>" \
  -d '{
    "input": { "text": "Hello, this is a test of Google Cloud Text to Speech." },
    "voice": { "languageCode": "en-US", "name": "en-US-WaveNet-D" },
    "audioConfig": { "audioEncoding": "LINEAR16" }
  }' \
  "https://texttospeech.googleapis.com/v1/text:synthesize" \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json,base64; data=json.load(sys.stdin); open('demo/output/test_gcloud.wav','wb').write(base64.b64decode(data['audioContent']))"
```

### ElevenLabs (cloud, paid, highest quality)

Uses ElevenLabs' voice cloning and synthesis — the most natural-sounding option.

Add credentials to `demo/.env`:

```env
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your-key-here
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=your-voice-id-here

# Voice tuning (all optional, defaults shown)
ELEVENLABS_STABILITY=0.4
ELEVENLABS_SIMILARITY_BOOST=0.75
ELEVENLABS_STYLE=0.3
ELEVENLABS_USE_SPEAKER_BOOST=true
```

- `stability` (0.0–1.0) — lower = more expressive, higher = monotone
- `similarity_boost` (0.0–1.0) — how closely it matches the original voice
- `style` (0.0–1.0) — style exaggeration for more expressiveness
- `use_speaker_boost` — enhances speaker similarity
- Requires a paid plan for cloned voices; pre-made voices work on free tier
- The `.env` file is gitignored

### Comparison

| Provider | Quality | Cost | Latency | Offline |
|----------|---------|------|---------|---------|
| Piper TTS | Robotic | Free | ~1s/segment | Yes |
| Google Cloud TTS (WaveNet) | Natural | Free tier (1M chars/mo) | ~2s/segment | No |
| ElevenLabs | Most natural | Paid (~$5/mo starter) | ~2s/segment | No |

## Usage

1. Start the API and frontend dev servers:
   ```bash
   claude-code-api                  # port 8000
   cd frontend && npm run dev       # port 5173
   ```

2. Make sure you have at least one active Claude Code session running (the demo clicks a session card).

3. Run the pipeline:
   ```bash
   python demo/run_demo.py --tts elevenlabs   # or: piper, google
   ```

4. Output lands in `demo/output/active-sessions-demo.mp4`.

## How it works

### Phase A: Audio generation
For each segment, narration text is sent to the selected TTS provider to generate an audio clip. Clip durations are measured with `ffprobe` to calculate Playwright timing. Non-WAV outputs (e.g. MP3 from ElevenLabs) are automatically converted to WAV before merging.

### Phase B: Browser recording
Playwright launches Chromium with `record_video_dir` and executes each segment's action (navigate, click, scroll, or wait). After each action, it sleeps for `max(audio_duration, pause_after_ms)` so the video has enough footage to cover the narration.

### Phase C: Audio/video merge
Audio clips are concatenated with silence gaps using ffmpeg's concat demuxer. The combined audio is merged with the browser video: `ffmpeg -i video.webm -i combined_audio.wav -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -shortest output.mp4`.

## Writing demo scripts

The `active-sessions-script.json` was generated by Claude Code. To create a new script for a different page or feature, prompt Claude Code with:

1. Which page/feature to demo
2. What actions to perform (navigate, click, scroll)
3. What the narration should convey

Claude Code reads the frontend source to determine the correct CSS selectors, wait conditions, and page structure, then generates a script JSON with narration text and timed actions. This is much faster than writing selectors by hand, since Claude can inspect the component tree to find the right elements.

## Customizing the script

Edit `active-sessions-script.json` to change narration or actions. Each segment has:

- `narration` — text spoken by TTS
- `action` — one of `navigate`, `click`, `scroll`, or `wait`
- `pause_after_ms` — minimum pause after the action (audio duration may extend this)
- `selector` — CSS selector for `click` actions
- `url` — URL for `navigate` actions
- `pixels` — scroll distance for `scroll` actions

## Known limitations

- **Active sessions required** — the current script clicks a session card, so at least one active/recent session must exist.
- **No cursor visualization** — Playwright's headless browser doesn't show a mouse cursor in the video.
